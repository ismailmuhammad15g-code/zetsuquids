    "Plan:\n",
    "1.  **Modify `GuideTimer.jsx`**:\n",
    "    *   Implement time formatting logic:\n",
    "        *   Calculate `minutes` and `seconds`.\n",
    "        *   Render `<Counter value={minutes} /> m <Counter value={seconds} /> s` if time > 60.\n",
    "        *   Render `<Counter value={seconds} /> s` otherwise.\n",
    "    *   Implement \"Sticky/Floating\" logic:\n",
    "        *   Use `IntersectionObserver` on a wrapper `div` to detect when the timer is scrolling out of view.\n",
    "        *   Actually, since the timer is inside the scrollable area, I need a \"sentinel\" element (an anchor) to watch.\n",
    "        *   When `isFloating` turns true, change the container's style to `fixed`, and move it to `bottom-4 right-4` (or top-right? User said \"moves to far right\", usually sticky headers are top, but floating tools are bottom. \"Stay with user\" often implies bottom-right or top-right. Let's aim for **Top Right** sticky header or **Bottom Right** floating action button style. Given it's a timer, Top Right sticky bar is common, but \"moves to far right\" implies a change of position. `GuidePage` has a `sticky top-0` header already.\n",
    "        *   Let's check `GuidePage.jsx` structure. The timer is in:\n",
    "            ```jsx\n",
    "            <div className=\"flex items-center justify-between mb-8\">\n",
    "              <Link ...>Back</Link>\n",
    "              <GuideTimer ... />\n",
    "            </div>\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "        *   This is inside `<article className=\"max-w-4xl ... py-8\">`.\n",
    "        *   If I make it `fixed`, it pops out of the flow.\n",
    "        *   User said: \"When scrolling down and it's not visible, it descends with the user smoothly... and moves to the far right\".\n",
    "        *   \"Descends with user\" -> sounds like it stays fixed on screen.\n",
    "        *   \"Moves to far right\" -> Originally it might be near the \"Back\" link or centered? In `GuidePage`, it's `justify-between`, so it's already on the **right** of that container.\n",
    "        *   But the container `max-w-4xl` is centered. The screen is wider.\n",
    "        *   So \"Far right\" means `right: 20px` of the viewport, not just the content container.\n",
    "        *   Animation: Use `framer-motion` `layout` prop for magic motion if possible, or manual variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Implementation Detail**:\n",
    "        *   Wrap the `GuideTimer` content in a `motion.div`.\n",
    "        *   Use a `ref` for the original position container.\n",
    "        *   Use `useEffect` to track scroll/intersection.\n",
    "        *   When sticky:\n",
    "            *   `position: fixed`\n",
    "            *   `top: 100px` (below header) or `bottom: 20px`? \"Descends with user\" might mean typical sticky behavior (top). \"Moves to right\" -> `right: 4`.\n",
    "        *   Let's try `top: 80px` (below the main header) and `right: 20px`.\n",
    "        *   Or maybe `top: 20px` if the header disappears? The header in `Layout` is `sticky`. `GuidePage` has `top-0 z-[100] w-full`.\n",
    "        *   The visual request: \"When you go down, the timer comes with you\".\n",
    "        *   \"Moves to far right to avoid distraction\".\n",
    "        *   I will place it at **Bottom Right** or **Top Right** outside the central column.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Refine Counter**:\n",
    "    *   Ensure `<Counter />` handles the number changes smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Execute**:\n",
    "    *   Edit `src/components/GuideTimer.jsx`.\n"

    "\n",
    "Why did I think `ul` z-index 5 would work?\n",
    "Because I forgot `ul` is inside `nav`. If `nav` and `effect` are siblings, `nav`'s children are trapped in `nav`'s layer unless `nav` is not a stacking context. `transform` makes it one. Even without transform, `position: relative` without z-index vs `position: absolute` with z-index 1... `z-index: 1` wins over `auto`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will set `nav { z-index: 10; }` in CSS.\n",
    "Also, I should double check if `effect.text` (z: 4) needs to be under `nav` or over?\n",
    "Actually, `effect.text` is the \"morphing\" text. It *should* be visible on top of the blob.\n",
    "If `nav` is on top of everything, we see stable text.\n",
    "The animation might rely on `effect.text` morphing.\n",
    "But `effect.text` is also z-index 4 (relative to container).\n",
    "If I set `nav` to z-index 10, it covers the animation text `effect.text`.\n",
    "Is that what we want?\n",
    "The \"gooey\" effect is usually the *background* moving. The text usually stays readable on top.\n",

    "1. Blob (effect filter) at bottom.\n",
    "2. Text (nav ul) at top.\n",

    "Plan to fix GooeyNav artifacts:\n",
    "1.  **Reduce Contrast**: The `contrast(100)` is extremely high. Lowering it (e.g., to ~20) might soften the edges slightly but still keep the gooey effect, or if the artifacts are due to aliasing, we might need a solid background.\n",
    "2.  **Add Background**: The \"gooey\" effect requires a solid background to composite against. If the background is transparent, the contrast filter creates jagged semi-transparent \"fizz\" around the edges. I will add `background: white` to the `.gooey-nav-container` or the filter layer to ensure smooth compositing, assuming the navbar is on white.\n",
    "3.  **Adjust Blur**: `blur(7px)` is quite large for small navigation items. I will reduce it to `blur(5px)`.\n",
    "4.  **Z-Index Correction**: Ensure the particles and blobs are firmly behind the text.\n",
    "5.  **Remove `effect text` duplication**: The React component renders the text normally in the list, but *also* has a duplicate `effect text` span. This is often done to handle the color change animation on top of the blob. I need to make sure they align perfectly. In the JSX, I manually forced the content. If they don't align, it looks like a smear.\n",
    "    *   Actually, the smear in the screenshot looks like the *filter* is being applied to the *text* too.\n",
    "    *   Looking at the CSS structure: `.gooey-nav-container .effect.filter` has the filter.\n",
    "    *   The `effect text` is a sibling.\n",
    "    *   But if the `.effect.filter` is on top of the text? `z-index: 1`.\n",
    "    *   The list `ul` has `z-index: 3`. So the list text is on top.\n",
    "    *   The `effect text` has `z-index: 1`. It is behind the list? No, `z-index` works inside the stacking context.\n",
    "    *   Wait, `.effect.filter` is `z-index: 1`. `.effect.text` is `z-index: 1`. `ul` is `z-index: 3`.\n",
    "    *   So the real text is on top. The `effect text` should be invisible or behind?\n",
    "    *   The `effect text` seems unused or redundant if `ul li` handles the text.\n",
    "    *   However, the JSX logic tries to copy text into `.effect.text`.\n",
    "    *   In the screenshot, the smear is \"black/dark\".\n",
    "    *   The \"Gooey\" effect is happening in `.effect.filter`.\n",

    "- The filter is `contrast(100)`. If the browser renders anti-aliased edges of the blob or particles against a transparent background, the alpha channel (0.1, 0.5, etc.) gets multiplied by 100.\n",
    "    - 0 * 100 = 0 (Transparent)\n",
    "    - 0.01 * 100 = 1 (Opaque)\n",
    "    - So *any* tiny anti-aliasing noise becomes a jagged block.\n",
    "- **Fix**: The container of the gooey effect *must* have a background color that matches the page background (White). The contrast filter then works by contrasting the colors, not just alpha.\n",
    "- But we want the transparency? If the header needs to be transparent, we are in trouble.\n",
    "- The `Layout.jsx` says `<header className=\"sticky top-0 z-[100] bg-white ...\">`. So the background is white.\n",
    "- So I can safely add `background: white` to the `.effect.filter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the \"Shadow\" or \"Dark Halo\" around the button might be the blur extending too far and getting clamped by the container, or just the contrast making the falloff look like a hard shadow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plan:\n",
    "1.  Add `background: white` to `.gooey-nav-container .effect.filter`.\n",
    "2.  Reduce contrast to `20` or `30`.\n",
    "3.  Reduce blur to `5px` or `6px`.\n",
    "4.  Remove `mix-blend-mode: normal` if not needed, or ensure it's correct.\n",
    "5.  Ensure `.effect.filter` has sufficient padding/inset so the blob doesn't clip."
