# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Project uses Vercel + Separate Backend
# Netlify configuration removed - see deployment instructions in README.md
#
# Frontend: Deploy to Vercel
# Backend: Deploy to separate server (Railway, Render, Heroku, VPS, etc.)
#
# Set VITE_API_URL environment variable in Vercel to point to backend server
