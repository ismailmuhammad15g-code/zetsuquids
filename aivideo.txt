# AI Video Generation Prompt: ZetsuGuide Deep Reasoning Showcase

**Visual Style:** 
High-contrast Black & White (Monochrome). Sleek, minimalist, futuristic tech aesthetic. 
The interface should look like a premium, high-end dark mode application.
Smooth, 60fps animations.
Use a distinct, white mouse cursor for all interactions.

**Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (Landscape) or 9:16 (Vertical) - optimized for social media.

## SCENE 1: The Activation (0:00 - 0:05)
**Visuals:**
- A close-up shot of a sleek, dark search bar floating in a void of deep black.
- A crisp white mouse cursor glides smoothly from the bottom right.
- The cursor hovers over a "Settings/Gear" icon inside the search bar. The icon glows slightly white upon hover.
- **ACTION:** The cursor clicks the icon.
- A semi-transparent, frosted-glass menu pops up instantly.
- Inside the menu, the cursor moves to a toggle switch labeled "Deep Reasoning Mode".
- **ACTION:** The cursor clicks the toggle.
- **EFFECT:** The switch flips ON. A pulse of energy (white light) ripples out from the switch, illuminating the edges of the search bar. The "Brain Circuit" icon lights up.

## SCENE 2: The Query (0:05 - 0:10)
**Visuals:**
- The cursor clicks into the input field.
- Text starts typing automatically (simulated typing): "Explain the architecture of Neural Networks."
- **ACTION:** The cursor clicks the "Send" arrow.
- The interface transitions smoothly to a "Thinking" state. The sailboat animation (or a loading pulse) begins.

## SCENE 3: Stage 1 - Extraction (0:10 - 0:15)
**Visuals:**
- **Transition:** The camera zooms INTSO the "Brain Icon", entering a digital abstract space.
- **Text Overlay (Elegant typography):** "STAGE 1: KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION"
- We see a central node (the query) glowing white.
- Beams of light shoot out from the center, identifying 5 distinct "Key Concepts".
- These concepts appear as floating white geometric blocks, organizing themselves into a neat stack.
- **Vibe:** Fast, precise, analytical.

## SCENE 4: Stage 2 - Deep Research (0:15 - 0:22)
**Visuals:**
- **Text Overlay:** "STAGE 2: GLOBAL RESEARCH"
- The camera pans out to show a vast network of nodes (representing the internet).
- Thousands of thin white lines extend from our central stack, connecting to distant points in the black void.
- Data packets (small white dots) travel rapidly rapidly along these lines back to the center.
- This represents real-time web scraping and data gathering.
- The network pulses with activity.

## SCENE 5: Stage 3 - Synthesis (0:22 - 0:28)
**Visuals:**
- **Text Overlay:** "STAGE 3: SYNTHESIS"
- The "Internal Blocks" (Scene 3) and the "External Data" (Scene 4) collide in the center.
- Instead of an explosion, they merge like liquid metal.
- They reform into a perfectly structured, glowing document.
- The chaos of data is refined into order.

## SCENE 6: The Result (0:28 - 0:35)
**Visuals:**
- **Transition:** Zoom OUT back to the main user interface.
- The AI response begins to stream in.
- It is not just a block of text; it is beautifully formatted.
- Sections appear with headers, bullet points, and code blocks.
- The "Deep Reasoning" badge glows softly in the corner, signifying a verified, high-quality answer.
- The mouse cursor moves to hover over the completed response, emphasizing the quality.

## SCENE 7: Outro (0:35 - 0:40)
**Visuals:**
- Fade to black.
- Logo appears in white: "ZetsuGuide AI"
- Subtitle: "Think Deeper."
- End.

**Audio / Music Suggestion:**
- Deep, bass-heavy ambient track.
- High-tech sound effects for clicks (crisp mechanical snaps).
- Digital "hum" or "data flow" sounds during the reasoning stages.
- No voiceover needed, or a deep, calm AI voice reading the stage titles.
